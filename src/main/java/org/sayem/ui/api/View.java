 * A View is the fundamental UI modeling type. It is some collection of elements and conditions,

 * "login" or "createNewUser"), as well as any necessary finer-grain user-input interactions such as
 * "typeLogin" and "typePassword" that the higher level functions might use.
 * <P>
 * A View is almost 1:1 with the concept of a page, except that you can define a View that is also a
 * subset of a page, like say a menu that using the same shared code, at the same shared location,
 * among several pages. Views can then include other Views and expose them via public getters or
 * forward their methods.
